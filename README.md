# xcash

Workis but does not install the shared delegate website on the server. everything else works though.

you will need to open at least one or two ports on the router for the delegate to communicate

Ported for ARM processor installation from Zacks autoinstaller script

auto installer for the xcash-dpops delegate




The pi-autoinstaller.sh is for Pi4 with 2 or 4 GB of memory
the installation for this can take 2-3 hours due to the long compile times


The pi-installer8gb.sh is for PIs with 8+gb of memory



tested on Ubuntu server 18.04 and 20.04

you have to have a 64bit OS or it probably wont work.
