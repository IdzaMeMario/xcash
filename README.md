# xcash




Ported for ARM processor installation from Zacks autoinstaller script

auto installer for the xcash-dpops delegate

At this point I can only reccomend doing this on a PI4. No other models have been tested and likely wont work well if at all.



You will need to open at least port 80, 18280 and 18283 on the router for the delegate to communicate
Your external IP must remain static it can not change or this will cause problems

tested on Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS
