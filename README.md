# xcash




Ported for ARM processor installation from Zacks autoinstaller script

auto installer for the xcash-dpops delegate


The pi-autoinstaller.sh is for Pi4 with 2 or 4 GB of memory
the installation for this can take 2-3 hours due to the long compile times


The pi-installer8gb.sh is for PIs with 8+gb of memory


You will need to open at least port 18280 and 18283 on the router for the delegate to communicate

tested on Ubuntu server 18.04 and 20.04

you have to have a 64bit OS or it probably wont work.
